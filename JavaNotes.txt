ArrayList and LinkedList. Which of the two List implementations you use depends on
your specific needs. If you need to support random access, without inserting or removing
elements from any place other than the end, then ArrayList offers the optimal collection.
If, however, you need to frequently add and remove elements from the middle of the list and
only access the list elements sequentially, then LinkedList offers the better
implementation.
