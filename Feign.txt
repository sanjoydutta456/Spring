Feign is a REST Service client. Feign can call the RESTful web services easily.
 When we use the RestTemplate to call the RESTful service, 
it creates duplication of code that talks to RESTful services.

When we define Feign, we need only to define a proxy and define a single method into it.
 Feign helps us to simplify client code to talk to the RESTful web services.

Datadog monitors every request for an application and tracks its delivery, which involves examining events down the application stacks.
